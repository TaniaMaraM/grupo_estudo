# Reverse String Exercise

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/description/

## Objective
The objective of this exercise is to write a program that takes a string as input and prints the string in reverse order.

## Instructions
1. Write a program in a programming language of your choice that prompts the user to enter a string.
2. Accept the string as input.
3. Reverse the input string.
4. Print the reversed string to the console.

## Example
Input:

Hello World

Output:

dlroW olleH


## Constraints
- The program should handle strings of any length.
- The program should not use built-in functions or libraries for string reversal.
- Ensure the program handles both uppercase and lowercase letters correctly.
- Handle edge cases, such as empty strings or strings with only one character.

## Bonus (Optional)
For an additional challenge, try to solve the problem using recursion or by implementing your own string reversal algorithm without using any built-in functions or libraries.

## Submission
Submit your program code along with any necessary instructions for running it.

## Notes
Encourage participants to test their programs with various input strings to ensure correctness and robustness.
